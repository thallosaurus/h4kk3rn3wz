const HELP = `
Hello! Glad you pressed me. You're probably wondering what happened to HackerNews. Well, we are hackers - elite - so, we're using elite speech (or 1337speek) :)

I tried to disable any possibility to get any userdata from you, because I created this page just for fun. I don't want to profit from this joke.

Want to check out the source code? Glad you asked. Find it here: https://github.com/thallosaurus/h4kk3rn3wz or in the Source Link in the header.

The whole stuff works by proxying hackernews and just replace every text node in the source. Simple as it can get.

Found a bug or want to help? Just send a pull request!`;
