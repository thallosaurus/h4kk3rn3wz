const HELP = `
Hello! Glad you pressed me. You're probably wondering what happened to HackerNews. Well, we are hackers - elite - so, we're using elite speech (or 1337speek) :)

I tried to disable any possibility to get any userdata from you, because I created this page just for fun. I don't want to profit from this joke.

This means:
- No login possible
- No comments

Found a bug or want to help? Just send a pull request!`;

function showHelp() {
    alert(HELP);
